# idhider

An experimental ID obfuscator based on symmetric cryptography.

## Example

From `133742` to `hgb95qpcy4y50`

 * Your internal `uint64`-typed ID (i.e., autogenerated by your RDBMS): `133742`
 * The "public" (encrypted) ID derived from it: `5781761883846612620` (still an
   `uint64`)
 * The human version (and URL-safe) of the public ID: `hgb95qpcy4y50`
   (Crockford's Base 32-encoded.)

## How it works

Blowfish (from `golang.org/x/crypto`) because:
 * it works on 64-bit blocks (the secret key can be much larger though),
 * provides [format-preserving encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Format-preserving_encryption)
   (the encrypted ID is an `uint64` integer as well.)
